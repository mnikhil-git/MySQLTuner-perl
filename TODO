Script: MySQL tuner script:
------------------
  - Build on existing RackerHacker's mysqltuner perl script. 
  - Add on any extra

1. Standardize the script in general
2. Avoid using backticks, system wherever if possible.
3. Initialise everything into variables including commands 
4. Remove hard coding
5. Provide additional tuning hooks as and when necessary. 
     MySQLTuner is great in itself, it provides almost all the array of performance tuning parameters check
     in general. I am just adding on top of it, according to my requirements or as I see it fit.

Additional hooks:-

1. check query_cache_type and query_cache_size
    check if query_cache_type is enabled then check the cache size.
    check individual query cache limit size

2. sort buffer size
    should be max connections * sort_buffer_size to be free in memory

3. If isam tables or myisam is on
    myisam_sort_buffer_size

4. WARN innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit-1: InnoDB is not
   configured in strictly ACID mode. 

5. log_warnings must be set greater than 1
6. log_bin should be enabled for point-in-time recovery and replication.
7. sync_bin_log 
8. innodb commit trx variables, innodb performance related variables 
9. Skip-networking if not needed, decide dynamic if there are not any inet/external connected hosts.
